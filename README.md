# An Empirical Study on the Possible Positive Effect of Imperative Constructs in Declarative Languages: The Case with SQL

This is the testing environment for my bachelor's thesis (2019).
The goal was to find out whether an alternative syntax of SQL might
aid programmers in developing queries more easily.
As part of my empirical study, test subjects will be presented with tasks to solve with the standard SQL syntax and with SQLAssign.
SQLAssign is a modification of SQL, such that variables can be used within SQL for subqueries.
The needed time to formulate the correct answer queries will be measured and analyzed.

The test can be run on a machine supporting a Java runtime environment.
Estimated time for one completion is about 2 hours.
After completion, sending me the generated CSV file is appreciated.
The email address can be found below as well.

Note: Experimentation is completed as of December 2019 and no further Datasets are required. Howevre, you can still experiment on your own terms.

## Syntaxvariants

- Standard SQL 
- Modified SQL (SQLAssign)

## Features

- Two different syntactical variations for SQL-Code
- A tutorial task
- A main experiment comprised of two tasks, one for each syntax variation
- A window that shows the set of all tables and their attributes
- A window where SQLAssign gets translated into standard SQL code
- A pausescreen after each task where time measurements are halted
- Generation of a CSV-File with all measuerd metrics after the completion of all tasks

## Results

- 24 Students of the University of Duisburg-Essen were tested
- The results show with significance (p<.001) that participants require about twice as long with the standard SQL syntax to generate correct queries for sufficiently complex tasks in comparison to SQLAssign
- The results suggest that small syntactical variations can lead to substancial improvements in the performance of programmers
